# wt-intern-hackathon
Working repository for WillowTree's 2022 Intern Hackathon! We worked on a web app called "Convenience Companion" to run on Anthem gas pumps. The frontend is implemented in React with MongoDB and Express in the backend. We also developed a functional voice integration using the Speechly API and deployed our project using a proprietary AWS pipeline.

Design: Adriana Gao, Tami Vu
Backend: Asha Nur
Frontend (General): Hannah Park, Victoria Ok
Product Management and Frontend (Voice Integration): Miriam Shams-Rainey
